			<p>Date: September 9, 2017<br />Time: 3:00 pm<br />Event: Vape-Off</p>

			<p>Join us on Saturday, September 9th as we kick off our 1st annual "Vape-Off"! Peeps from around the metro area will all gather to compete to see who can pull off the sickest vape tricks. We're talkin' hoops. We're talkin' rings. We're talkin' hoops going into other rings, and if you're lucky, vice-versa! So make sure you mark your calendar for this event. Also, Puff The Magic DJ will be spinning your favorite Limp Bizkit records.</p>

			<p>Date: September 23, 2017<br />Time: 6:00 pm<br />Event: Moustache Grooming 101</p>

			<p>I mustache you a few questions: Are you sick of your boring a$$ mustache or beard? Feel like you need a fresh new look, or some info on how to tame that mane? Well look no further. Join us on Saturday September 9th at the civic center where we’ll all be schooled by barber and master face sculptor Chad John Jonny. He’s gonna give us the tips and tricks for nailing that perfect mustache curl or beard braid. Free beeswax will be handed out to the first 17 Chads that show up to this event, so make sure to arrive early!</p>

			<p>Date: October 14, 2017<br />Time: 12:00 pm<br />Event: Fidget spinner and yo-yo competition</p>

			<p>October is national “Really Weird and Lame Hobbies” month, so naturally we had to throw a fidget spinner and yo-yo competition. We’re starting to run out of money for these things, so we’re having this event at Chad’s mom’s house. She only has a double-wide trailer, but it sits on a really nice plot of land (almost a full acre!). Also, her bathroom is off-limits. So bring your fidget spinner/yo-yo game face, and get ready for a silly good time. Also, Puff The Magic DJ will be back for this event to lubricate the crowd with hella-good sound vibes. Just a heads up though, he’s only playing “You Spin Me Round” by Dead Or Alive, but if you tip him $5, he might play you the Flo-Rida remix.</p>

			<p>Date: October 31, 2017<br />Time: 5:00 pm<br />Hoverboard Spooktacular</p>

			<p>It’s that time of year again! And no, I’m not talking about that time where we went around explaining “mansplaining” to every woman we could find. I’m talking about the 3rd annual Hoverboard Spooktacular! This year’s event is going to take place at the University, where we’ll have our normal Hoverboard race, then afterward we’ll put on our grim reaper costumes and chase students around campus.<br /><br />
			<small>*Disclaimer: The Brocery Story is not responsible for any damage done to participants and/or their Hoverboards if the students of the University decide to retaliate like they did last year.</small></p>

			<p>Date: December 15, 2017<br />Time: 2:00 pm<br />Lifting for Jesus</p>

			<p>Dost thou even lift, Bro? Bring your bro-tein shake mix and your favorite sleeveless t-shirt, and come humble yourself before Santa and the lord as we kick off our 2nd annual Lifting for Jesus event. We will be having several exhibition tournaments, such as swinging rope until your arms get tired, and hitting tires with a sledge hammer. Our main event will be to see who can do the most pull-ups before puking. The winner will receive a kettle bell in the shape of Jesus’ head. There will also be a Santa costume contest.</p>
